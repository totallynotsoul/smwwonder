Should be 10 items total in case a file is missing.

Updates (dd/mm/yyyy):
 16/07/2022 (V1.4.4) (TheBiob)
  - GPS now prints asar warnings instead of ignoring them.

 01/01/2022 (V1.4.3) (TheBiob)
  - GPS now uses Asar 1.81's dll
  - Changed changelog date format to dd/mm/yyyy. Fixed dates in the wrong format
  - Changed the sa-1 address of the extra_byte defines to use absolute addresses instead of long ones
  - Rearranged main.asm to circumvent an asar bug (see https://github.com/RPGHacker/asar/issues/216)
  - Added new routines: get_map16, set_item_memory
  - Added current layer to routines/sprite_block_position.asm
  - Added an error if insert size is negative or exceeds an entire bank
  - Added !sprite_slots define
  - Updated the snes_to_pc/pc_to_snes functions to PIXIs implementation
  - Updated the shatter_block and rainbow_shatter_block routines to Akaginites layer 2 independent versions (taken from https://www.smwcentral.net/?p=section&a=details&id=14099&r=0)
  - Linked the Custom Bounce Block patch in the readme
  - Clarified that the "Error on line x" message is from the block list, not some other file
  - A missing return in glitter.asm was fixed

 01/11/2020 (V1.4.21) (TheBiob)
  - Removed align attribute for fullsa1 roms as asar doesn't seem to like that
  - Removed namespaces and all normal labels from subroutines to prevent issues with sublabels and nested subroutines
  - Added |!bank to main.asm for better fastrom compatibility

 21/07/2020 (V1.4.2) (TheBiob) (rejected)
  - GPS now uses Asar 1.71's dll
  - Fixed normal labels in spawn_sprite.asm, spawn_sprite_block.asm and glitter.asm preventing sublabel bugs when calling the routines
  - Fixed SA-1 ROMs of 6MB+ sizes not using fullsa1rom as the mapper
  - Changed freespace finding to aligned so asar stops throwing bankcross errors
  - Blocks can now use the full feature set of DSC files (as of the release of this update at least, see readme for details on how to use them)

 01/02/2019 (V1.4.1) (yes, a second one) (???)
  - Changed sprite extra byte define names, breaking compatibility. Reverted in the next update.

 30/12/2018 (V1.4.1) (TheBiob, Majorflare, MarioFanGamer)
  - Fixed change_map16.asm not working in vertical levels
  - Fixed check_sprite_kicked_vertical.asm not working on sa-1 (Majorflare)
  - Added custom bounce sprites support in spawn_bounce_block.asm (MarioFanGamer)
     Note that the map16 tile was moved from $02 to $03 which breaks resources that expect it to be $02 so keep that in mind

 25/12/2018 (V1.4.0) (TheBiob)
  - GPS now uses Asar 1.60's dll
  - Now tells you which version you're using
  - Now removes all temporary files unless -k is provided
  - Added support for big level layouts
  - Added new option -rom
  - Fixed sublabel issue when using routines
  - Fixed more sublabel issues when using routines
  - Fixed change_map16.asm messing up in sprite offsets
  - Fixed an oversight where the first routine pointer would overwrite the end of the "The End" screen tilemap
  - Fixed GPS not inserting when block paths have spaces in them
  - Fixed spawn_item_sprite.asm and check_sprite_kicked_horizontal.asm not working on SA-1
  - Fixed a minor oversight with spawn_bounce_sprite.asm where it did not return the used slot in Y properly

 07/05/2018 (V1.3.1) (TheBiob)
  - Fixed a bug with descriptions not working if there was a block between two with the same file name
  - Fixed GPS breaking 6MB+ SA-1 ROMS because Asar doesn't fully support full sa1 roms yet
  - Fixed rainbow_shatter_block.asm breaking on non-SA-1 due to a falsely put !bank8
  - teleport.asm now sets the "exit exists" flag automatically. A bit slower in most cases but more true to what the description says it does.
  - Added new standard routines
    - layer2_sprite_position.asm ; Gets the actual sprite position even if the block is placed on layer 2

 16/10/2017 (V1.3.0) (TheBiob)
  - Now supports Lunar Magic's new Map16 pages (Pages 40+)
  - Added "@dsc" command to the list file
  - Added new standard routines
    - swap_XY.asm
    - move_spawn_relative.asm
    - check_sprite_kicked_vertical.asm
    - check_sprite_kicked_horizontal.asm
    - spawn_sprite_block.asm
  - Updated routines
    - change_map16.asm (Faster and smaller version, Akaginite)
    - spawn_bounce_sprite (Now allows for usage with the Bounce Block Unrestrictor and/or Custom Bounce Blocks, MarioFanGamer) (Read the comments in the asm file for more information)
  - (Officially) Added ways to assign the same file and acts like to multiple blocks in one line
  - GPS now uses Asar 1.50's dll
  - List file now supports comments (; at the beginning of a line)
  - Added additional information in block_clean.asm telling you what it's cleaning (This was mainly used for debugging but I figured someone might find this useful so I left it in)
  - Fixed a minor bug which no one noticed since it's something no one would ever do so I'm not sure why I mention it here (You were forced to put JMP after db $37 for it to work which is now fixed)

 15/03/2017 (V1.2.31) (TheBiob)
  - Added another overlooked offset to db $37

 11/03/2017 (V1.2.3) (TheBiob)
  - Added a new header (db $37) which allows a block to use the new Wallrun offset

 27/02/2017 (V1.2.2) (GHB) (rejected)
  - Was removed because the new offset was not optional causing all current blocks to be incompatible.

 08/02/2017 (V1.2.1) (GHB)
  - Fix a bug where spriteH may not execute block codes when embedded deeply in the block. This can be
    proven by having a block act like $130 via Lunar magic, but have spriteH and spriteV both run this code:
     ;----code----;
      LDY #$00
      LDA #$25
      STA $1693
     ;----end_code----;
    which causes the sprites (mostly dropped sprites, like shells) to be pushed out. Therefore, the block
    partially behaves $025. This works the other way around too: $025 by Lunar Magic, behaves $130 with
    block codes and the blocks fail to push sprites outward.

  - Added another block offset: MarioWallRun.
