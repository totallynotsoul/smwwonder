; --- bookmark list: How to Use ---
; this is a list of programs you can define for easy access using keyboard shortcuts.

; the shortcuts are CTRL+(1/2/3.../9/0)
; the order is from top to bottom, the first shortcut is accessed with CTRL+1,
; the one below it CTRL+2 and it goes until CTRL+9 and CTRL+0.

; you can also use CTRL+M to access shortcuts while they're displayed.

; any define from the config file is usable here.
; there's also !rom_path! which is the rom's folder, !rom_file! which is the rom's full path, name + extension,
; and !rom_name! which is just the rom's name (no extension).

; the default directory for short paths is the resources folder.

; if your file path has spaces, make sure to encase it with double quotes: "path"

;=============================================================================================

; example: this opens your defined list opening program, using CTRL+1
"!list_program!"

; another example, this opens your patch list with the defined list program, using CTRL+2
"!list_program!" "!patch_list!"

; ANOTHER example, this opens another instance of lunar magic with the currently open ROM.
; (which is completely useless) use CTRL+3.

"Lunar Magic/Lunar Magic.exe" "!rom_file!"
