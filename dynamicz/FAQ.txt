Q: This version use extrabit like the others versions?
A: No.

Q: When I use a Semi Dynamic Sprites, other sprites have glitchs graphics, Why it happend?
A: Semi Dynamic Sprites replace graphics in SP2 or SP3 for them own graphics, I recommend use them on areas
where the player can't return.

Q: When I use a lot of Dynamic Sprites, sometimes there is a little black line on the top, Why it happend?
A: If you use a lot of Dynamic Sprites on the screen you can cause an overload of DMA, The only solution for
that is use less Dynamic Sprites or use something black on the top. It generally happend with Dynamic Sprites
of 80x80. Probably on future versions I will make a fix for that.

Q: When I use a Dynamic sprite of 96x96 or 112x112, others sprites have glitch graphics, Why it happend?
A: Dynamic Sprites of 96x96 or 112x112, will use ALL SP2 and SP3 and on the case of 112x112 also will use SP4.

Q: How many bytes can I transfer per frame?
A: 2 kb (Mid GFX) or 3kb if you use Mode 50% more (3/4 of GFX).

Q: Dynamic Z have a lot of incompatibilities, Will you make a Dynamic version of features with incompatibilities?
A: For some features yes like LX's custom power ups or some patches that use Status Bar, but for others 
I think that is innecesary like mario DMAer or 32x32 player.

Q: Is possible transform a normal sprite into a Semi-Dynamic Sprite?
A: If the sprite use less than 2 GFX yes, if it use more no. 

Q: Dyzen will make Giant Dynamic Sprites, 80x80 Dynamic Sprites and Semi-Dynamic Sprites?
A: Yes, wait for Dyzen V 3.2

Q: Can I make a cluster or extended Dynamic Sprite?
A: Yes, is possible but you it have some changes. Maybe it will be available on Dyzen V 3.5

Q: What are those header_(nosa1).asm and header_(sa1).asm?
A: In order to allow you to use the dynamic sprites on the sprite tool, the header has been
splitted in order to allow easy usage, just copy one or another into the sprite folder
rename them to header.asm only and insert your sprite.
